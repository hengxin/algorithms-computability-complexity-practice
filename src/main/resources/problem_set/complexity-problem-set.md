# Problem Set on Computational Complexity

## Satisfiability Problem
- [NP-hardness of covering with rectangular pieces (Google Hash Code 2015 Test Round)](http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/49074/4911)

## 3-PARTITION Problem
- [The Even Palindrome Problem](http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/57335/4911)

## Hamiltonian Path/Cycle
- [Finding the lowest-weight negative cycle in a weighted digraph](http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/54829/4911)

  `Reduction: make each edge (undirected graph version) have weight −1. There is a cycle of least weight at most −n iff the graph is Hamiltonian.`
