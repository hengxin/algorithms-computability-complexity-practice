# Challenging Data Structure Problem Set

This document collects challenging problems on data structures.

## Balanced Search Tree

- [An online algorithm to find the Pareto frontier elements (from cs.se)](http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/52201/4911)
  
  Use balanced binary tree data structure.

- [Delete a consecutive range of leaves from a binary tree (from cs.se)](http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/52457/4911)

  This can be done in $O(d)$ time, regardless of $i,j$.
