## Graph Algorithms

### DFS and BFS

- [Algorithm to find shortest lightest path in a graph from source](http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/51721/4911)

`This problem can be solved by both BFS and Dijkstra's SSSP algorithm.`


### Path problems

- [Dijkstra's algorithm with different color nodes](http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/33056/4911)

`The task is to determine if a colorful path exists, and if so, find one that contains a minimum number of white nodes.`

- [Minimax path problem](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/5195/reference-for-fast-algorithm-for-bottleneck-shortest-paths) 

> Specifically, given vertices `$s$` and `$t$` in an undirected graph with edge weights, you want the shortest path from `$s$` to `$t$`, where the length of a path is the maximum edge on that path. This can be solved in `$O(n+m)$` time by finding the median edge weight and (carefully) recursively deleting half the edges.

- [Longest path in an undirected tree with only one traversal](http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/11263/4911)

`We perform a depth-first search in post order and aggregate results on the way, that is we solve the problem recursively.`
