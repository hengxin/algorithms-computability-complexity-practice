# Algorithm Resources List

## Books
- [A List of Online Available Books on Algorithms: Algorithms and Data Structures](http://www.freetechbooks.com/algorithms-and-data-structures-f11.html)
- [Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

  The booksite consists of the following elements:
  - Excerpts. A condensed version of the text narrative, for reference while online.
  - Java code. The algorithms and clients in this textbook.
  - Exercise solutions. Solutions to selected exercises.

## Online Algorithms Lists
- [Stony Brook Algorithms Repository](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~algorith/)

  This WWW page is intended to serve as a comprehensive collection of algorithm implementations for over seventy of the most fundamental problems in combinatorial algorithms. The problem taxonomy, implementations, and supporting material are all drawn from my book The Algorithm Design Manual. Since the practical person is more often looking for a program than an algorithm, we provide pointers to solid implementations of useful algorithms, when they are available.
- [ACM Collected Algorithms](http://calgo.acm.org/)

  The Collected Algorithms (CALGO) is part of a family of publications produced by the ACM.
  
  It contains complete source code.
